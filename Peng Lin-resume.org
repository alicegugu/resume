** Research & Projects
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :environment tabularx :width \linewidth :spread t :align lX
| 2015.11-present | *Graph Association Rule Mining and Applications*: /Current Project at/ WSU. The project is to study association rule mining and its applications. One application is temporal *event detection*, which is to analyze the significant patterns over temporal graph data. The work is based on efficient and effective graph matching and mining algorithms, and it extends static graph mining to predict the interesting patterns over temporal graphs. The initial work was built on Spark/GraphX. Another application is *knowledge graph quality and cleaning*. Association rules can be applied as error detection rules and data cleaning rules over large-scale knowledge graphs. We are developing (distributed) quality rule mining, error detection and data cleaning techniques using association rules. |
| 2014.04-2015.07 | *Color non-uniformity correction*: /Research Project at/ Marvell. I researched and designed a color correction method, which used PCA to compress massive features and then optimized to the minimal entropy. See draft: @@latex:{\href{https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxwZW5nbGluMDN8Z3g6N2M0OGZkNWNlY2E4MzY1MA}{PDF}}@@. Also, in order to run algorithms on embedded systems with limited resources, I built a standalone matrix library with numerical stability for embedded systems. See @@latex:{\href{https://github.com/penglin03/Numic}{code}}@@                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2011.03-2012.03 | *Human body part recognition*: /Master's project at/ SJTU. The motivation of this project was to do fast recognition. I investigated and implemented a human body part recognition algorithm, by the techniques of depth imaging and ensemble learning. Compared with geometry based methods, the algorithm used less context but gained real time performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
