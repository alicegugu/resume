** Research & Projects
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :environment longtabu :width \linewidth :spread t :align lX
| 2011.03-2012.03 | *Human body part recognition*: /Master's project at/ SJTU. The motivation of this project was to do fast segmentation and human body classification by random forest. I investigated and implemented a human body part recognition algorithm, by exploiting the techniques of depth imaging and ensemble learning. Compared with other geometry based methods, the algorithm used less locality information but gained a real time classification. (Advisor: Yuming Zhao)                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2014.04-present | *Color non-uniformity correction*: /Current project/. The Color Non-Uniformity (Shading) Correction is an intractable problem in mobile camera. I am researching and designing a vectorization based method, which compresses features from massive white charts and searches the best fitting curve to minimize entropy. To embedded systems, I am building up a minimal matrix library with numerical stability and accuracy. Sample code: @@latex:{\href{https://github.com/penglin03/Numic}{Numic}}@@, (@@latex:{\href{https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/content/matrix-computations-0}{ref: Matrix Computations 4th}}@@) |
| 2013.07-2014.03 | *Camera calibration & tuning*: I tuned a hundred of parameters for the algorithms to reach best image quality. I was researching @@latex:{\href{http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Color-Imaging-Science-Hsien-Che/dp/0521103134}{Color Science}}@@ and building up standard workflows of tests. The tests could attribute to the algorithms, which caused the defect, like whether sharpening or de-noise caused texture loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2012.10-2013.06 | *Algorithms on image processor*: This was a prospective study aimed to test the Image Processor's parallel capability in complex algorithms. I implemented parallel algorithms in Python, which included format conversion, image filtering, feature extraction and texture processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 2012.07-2012.09 | *Panorama optimization*: The hotspot was in mosaic and pyramid blending. I searched and employed the linear interpolation to replace default non-linear functions, combined with LUT and fixed point computing. On 1GHz CPUs, the time cost was reduced from 20s to 10s per frame.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
